# Software

Here is the modification of the original software tailored for the use of the 2708. The original software can be found [here](https://github.com/Kris-Sekula/EPROM-EMU-NG). I have modified a couple of parameters in the Arduino sketch and Python script, allowing the 2708 to be selected directly from the menu.
